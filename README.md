# Options
#Options project


'''

Derivatives project utilising OOP in Python. Options are priced using the Black Scholes equation with an initial 

    hedge being calculated. The Option is created within the parent class (acting as an abstract class) with specific 

          methods polymorphically delegated to each respective child class representing either a call option or a put option.
          

An in-memory database has been created with SQLite3 to store the price and initial delta of any new option which is created.
